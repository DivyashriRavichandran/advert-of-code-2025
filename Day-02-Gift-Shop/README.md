## 🎄 Day 2: Gift Shop

You’re given several product ID ranges. An ID is invalid if it is made of a sequence of digits repeated twice (e.g., 11, 6464, 123123).

### Part 1

Check every ID in the given ranges and find all invalid IDs. Then add all invalid IDs together to get the final answer.

### Part 2

Now an ID is invalid if it’s made of any digit sequence repeated two or more times (e.g. 1212121212). Find all such IDs in the ranges and sum them up using the new rule.
