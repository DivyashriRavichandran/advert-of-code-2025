## 🎄 Day 6: Trash Compactor

Cephalopod worksheets show vertical problems side-by-side, each with a stack of numbers and a bottom symbol (+ or \* ) indicating whether to add or multiply them.

### Part 1

Compute every problem’s result, then sum them all to get the grand total.

### Part 2

The worksheet is read right-to-left by columns. Each column forms a number from top to bottom, then applies the operator at the bottom.

Compute each column’s result and sum them to get the new grand total.
